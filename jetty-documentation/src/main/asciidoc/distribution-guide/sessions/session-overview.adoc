=== Session Overview

==== Terminology 

Before diving into the specifics of how to plug-in and configure various alternative http session management modules, let's review some useful terminology:

SessionIdManager:: Each jetty instance can have a single SessionIdManager that is responsible for managing session ids.
HouseKeeper:: Each jetty instance can have a single HouseKeeper that is responsible for finding and orchestrating the removal of expired sessions.
SessionCache:: Each context can have a single SessionCache that is an L1 cache of in-use session objects.
SessionDataStore:: Each context can have a single SessionDataStore that is responsible for all persistence operations on sessions.
CachingSessionDataStore:: Each context can have a single CachingSessionDataStore that is an L2 cache of session data.
SessionHandler:: Each context can have a single SessionHandler that is responsible for managing the lifecycle of sessions.

==== Jetty Session Modules

There are a number of modules that offer pluggable alternatives for http session management.
You can design how you want to cache and store http sessions by selecting alternative combinations of session modules.

For example, jetty ships with two alternative implementations of the `SessionCache`: one that caches sessions in memory (`session-cache-hash.mod`) and a trivial implementation that does not actually cache (`session-cache-null.mod`).

There are at least six alternative implementations of the `SessionDataStore` that you can use to persist your http sessions.
The list current includes support for:
* file system storage (`session-store-file.mod`)
* relational database (`session-store-jdbc.mod`)
* NoSQL database (`session-store-mongo.mod`)
* Google Cloud datastore (`session-store-gcloud.mod`)
* Hazelcast (`session-store-hazelcast-remote.mod` or `session-store-hazelcast-embedded.mod`)
* Infinispan (`session-store-infinispan-remote.mod` or `session-store-infinispan-embedded.mod`)

You might like to consult the [use-cases] to help you decide which combinations best suit your needs.

TIP
It is worth noting that if you do not configure _any_ session modules, jetty will still provide http sessions that are cached in memory, but that are never persisted.
