=== Session Architecture

==== Session Architecture Hierarchy

Each Jetty instance has a singular `SessionIdManager` to handle all session requests, regardless of clustering technology.
For each context on the server there is one (1) `SessionCache` which contains all of the Session objects for the given context.
The benefit of the `SessionCache` is to ensure that simultaneous requests accessing the same Session Id in the same context always operate on the same Session object.
The SessionCache implementation supplied with the Jetty distribution does just that: keeps Session objects in memory so that they can be shared between simultaneous requests.
However, it is possible to provide your own implementation that never shares Session objects should you require it.

Where the `SessionCache` handles Session information, Session data is stored in a `SessionDataStore` that is specific to the clustering technology being implemented.
There is only one (1) `SessionDataStore` per `SessionCache`.

Visually the session architecture can be represented like this:
